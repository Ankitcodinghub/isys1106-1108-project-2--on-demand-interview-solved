<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Scenario 1: Team’s progress presented on burndown charts

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The team is working on a Scrum project in <strong>fortnightly sprints</strong>, the project is planned for <strong>5 sprints</strong>. The Sprint 1 has been started on <strong>4 March</strong>. In your analysis, please take into account that <strong>the following days are public holidays</strong> in Victoria:

<ul>
<li>11 March (Monday, Labour Day)</li>
<li>29 March (Good Friday) – 1 April (Easter Monday)</li>
<li>25 April (ANZAC Day, Thursday)</li>
</ul>
At the beginning of the project (just before the team started Sprint 1) The overall sum of story points in the product backlog was 137.

Please take the following information regarding the efforts of the following <em>High priority</em> PBIs (Product Backlog Items), specified in story points:

<ul>
<li>PBI-1: 8 story points</li>
<li>PBI-2: 2 story points</li>
<li>PBI-3: 5 story points</li>
<li>PBI-4: 3 story points</li>
<li>PBI-5: 1 story point</li>
<li>PBI-6: 8 story points</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li>PBI-7: 3 story points</li>
<li>PBI-8: 2 story points</li>
<li>PBI-9: 8 story points</li>
<li>PBI-10: 3 story points</li>
<li>PBI-11: 2 story points</li>
<li>PBI-12: 8 story points</li>
</ul>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

The product backlog doesn’t contain any Critical priority items, but it contains several other High and Medium priority items. At the end of Sprint 0, it also contains only three Low priority items:

<ul>
<li>PBI-39 estimated as 13 story points</li>
<li>PBI-40 estimated as 21 story points</li>
<li>PBI-41 estimated as 13 story points</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

You also need to take into account the following events of the scenario:

At the sprint planning meeting for Sprint 2, the Product Owner requested to add to the Product Backlog two low priority items: PBI-42 and PBI-43. The team and Scrum Master agreed to this change, the team estimated the efforts for them as 5 story points each.

At that meeting, the Product Owner decided to remove PBI-24 and PBI-25 from the Product Backlog (previously, PBI-24 was estimated as 3 story points, and PBI-25 was estimated as 1 story point). Both items have been previously assessed as medium priority items. The team and Scrum Master agreed to this change as well.

<strong><u>Interview tasks for the video on burn-down chart (based on Scenario 1):</u></strong>

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

You need to create the corresponding <strong>burndown chart</strong> for the project (<strong>as it should be at the very end of Sprint 2, after the Sprint review meeting</strong>) and record video, where you need to present it. You can selected here between two options:

<ul>
<li>Option 1: classical burn-down chart</li>
<li>Option 2: calendar-based burn-down chart</li>
</ul>
In the presentation, you need to cover the following points (please don’t forget to mention which of two options you selected to create – a classical or a calendar-based burndown chart):

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<strong>Task 1:</strong> Explain how you created the ideal burndown – how you decided what should be its top point, how you calculated the number of working days in the project and the ideal daily velocity, how/whether the decisions announced by the Product Owner on Sprint 2 Planning and Review meetings influenced your calculations.

&nbsp;

<strong>Task 2:</strong> Explain how your real burndown was evolving day by day over the duration of sprints.

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<strong>Task 3 (Variant for Bachelor students):</strong> Calculate ideal, acceptable and real velocities for the provided scenario. Explain what you can conclude from the results of calculations.

<strong>Task 3 (Variant for Master students): </strong>Analyse the chances of the team to complete the project successfully, if they continue with the same real velocity and capacity as at the end of Sprint 2.

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<strong>Please note that the video should contain both, screen capture and camera capture of you, for the whole duration of presentation. </strong>

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<h1>Scenario 2: Quality Assurance analysis</h1>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

The team decided to have detailed sprint task approach where the development tasks are specified reflecting Acceptance Criteria (ACs): as the content of most user stories in the product backlog for this project is nontrivial, it would be incorrect for the team to follow a lightweight approach with general development task approach.

&nbsp;

The team decided that information radiator will be an Excel spreadsheet with a Product backlog, and for each Sprint they are going to create Excel spreadsheet with a Sprint backlog (all spreadsheets shared with all team members in OneDrive, with Edit-rights).

&nbsp;

When preparing to the Sprint 1 planning meeting, the team also created Acceptance Criteria (ACs) for a number of high-priority PBIs. The ACs for

&nbsp;

<strong>PBI 15.</strong> As a customer, I want to select whether I will pay for my order with credit card or PayPal, so that I have flexibility of payment.

<em>&nbsp;</em>

have been specified as follows:

&nbsp;

<strong>AC13.1&nbsp; </strong>

<strong>Given </strong>the customer is on the cart page of the application

<strong>When</strong> the customer selects the option “payment with credit card”,

<strong>Then</strong> the payment option for this order will be stored as “CreditCard” <strong>and</strong> the application will present to the customer a screen “Please enter details of your credit card” with fields to enter credit card number, name on the card, and the expire date of the card.

&nbsp;

The below screenshot (of a part of a Trello card) presents sprint tasks they specified:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Please note that the team, Product Owner and Scrum Master agreed to the following Definitions of Done for the functionalities to be developed for customer users:

<ul>
<li>Unit testing passed (code coverage 80%)</li>
<li>Code peer reviewed</li>
<li>Functional testing based on ACs passed (manual testing)</li>
<li>Usability testing passed (Chrome 123.0, Safari 17.4.1)</li>
<li>Regression testing passed <em>&nbsp;</em></li>
<li>Approved by the Product Owner</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>

<strong><em><u>Interview tasks for the video on QA analysis:</u> </em></strong>

<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>

<strong>Task 1:</strong> You need to analyse the specified <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>, explain what issues you identified and demonstrate how exactly they should be fixed (create and present a corrected version of Acceptance Criteria).

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<strong>Task 2:</strong> You need to analyse the <strong>sprint tasks</strong>, explain what issues you identified and demonstrate how exactly they should be fixed (create and present a corrected version of sprint tasks for this PBI).

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<strong>Task 3 (Variant for Bachelor students):</strong> You need to specify <strong>test cases</strong> for a sprint task that aims to cover the following item of the Definition of Done: <em>Functional testing based on ACs passed (manual testing)</em>.

<strong>Task 3 (Variant for Master students): </strong>You need to specify <strong>test cases</strong> for a sprint task that aims to cover the following item of the Definition of Done: <em>Functional testing based on ACs passed (manual testing)</em>. Gou also need to discuss what would be different in your activities if this item of the Definition of Done would be formulated as <em>Functional testing based on ACs passed (automated testing using Selenium)</em>.

<strong>Please note that the video should contain both, screen capture and camera capture of you, for the whole duration of presentation. </strong>

<h1>Scenario 3: Product Backlog analysis</h1>
&nbsp;

The Product Backlog (as per the end of Sprint 0) is presented below. The team, Product Owner and Scrum Master agreed to the following Definitions of Done, where DoD1 was specified to cover staff functionality, and DoD2 was specified to cover customer functionality:

DoD1:

<ul>
<li>Unit testing passed (code coverage 80%)</li>
<li>Code peer reviewed</li>
<li>Functional testing based on ACs passed</li>
<li>Usability testing passed (Chrome 123.0, Safari 17.4.1)</li>
<li>Regression testing passed <em>&nbsp;</em></li>
<li>Approved by the Product Owner DoD2:</li>
<li>Unit testing passed (code coverage 75%)</li>
<li>Code peer reviewed</li>
<li>Functional testing based on ACs passed</li>
<li>Usability testing passed (Chrome 123.0, Safari 17.4.1, Mozilla Firefox 117.0)</li>
